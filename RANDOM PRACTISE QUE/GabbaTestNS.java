//    Problem Statement
//    Australia hasnâ€™t lost a Test Match at the Gabby since 1988. India has to win this one, but unfortunately, all of their players are injured.
//
//    You are given the following information:
//            1. A total of N players is available, all are injured initially.
//            2. You have M magic pills. Using X pills, you can make any one player fit for a match.
//            3. Alternatively, you can exchange any player for Y magic pills.
//
//    Compute the maximum number of players you can make fit for the Gabby Test Match.
//
//    Note: "Exchanging" a player means that player will no longer be available, and you will gain Y extra magic pills for the exchange
//    Input:
//    The input contains a single line containing 4 integers N M X Y.
//    Output:
//    The output should contain a single integer representing the maximum number of players you can make fit before the match.
